## About

Here is my assignment for Vincit's recruitment process. I could not get the original API call working by fetch due to CORS policy. Thus, I decided to serve the csv file in Node.js

**Important**:
render.js is modified from a course template provided by Tampere University staff. I do, however, understand how it functions.
