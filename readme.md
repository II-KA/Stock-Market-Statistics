## About

My take on Vincit's assignment. I could not get the original API call working by fetch due to CORS policy. Thus, I decided to handle the csv file in Node.js and serve it as json content.

**Important**:
render.js is modified from a course template provided by Tampere University staff. I, however, do understand how it functions.
